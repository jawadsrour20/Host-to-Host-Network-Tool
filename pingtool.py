'''
    percetnage packet loss = (sent_packets - received_packets)/sent_packets * 100

    Delay = RTT = difference in time between send and receive packets

    sequence number helps to match replies with requests within the process. That is necessary to calculate the RTT (round-trip time) and to detect unanswered pings.

'''


'''
    The following prgram is built based on the module of the Ping model
    It is also similar to the original ping model in the  ICMP echo request and ICMP echo reply
    
    The purpose of this program is to find the time delay and the packet loss percentage when sending and receiving packets for a user chosen server
    
    you can either input the server's DNS or the IP address
    
    Testing with loopback address
    
    The program uses the following libraries:
    - multi-threading
    - socket programming
    - struct
    - os  (to get the process id when sending an echo request)
    - time (used to find the delay between sending and receiving packets to the server)
